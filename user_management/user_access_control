Lock the password
------------------
To lock a users account use the command usermod -L or passwd -l. 
Both the commands adds an exclamation mark (“!”) 
in the second field of the file /etc/passwd. For example :


# usermod -L testuser
Before and After this activity check the #cat /etc/passwd
or
# passwd -l testuser


Expire the user account
=======================
The commands passwd -l and usermod -L are ineffcient when it comes 
to disable/lock user accounts. 

To completely disable user accounts you can user the command #chage -E0

# chage -E0 testuser

Expiring an account via use of the 8th field in /etc/shadow (using “chage -E”)
will block all access methods that use PAM to authenticate a user.





Verify if the account is locked or disabled.
===========================================
For each of the methods described above, you can verify if the user account 
is locked/disabled using below methods.

1. Check if the user account is locked.

Check for the flag *LK* in the below command output which indicates that the 
account is locked.

# passwd --status root

root *LK* 2017-07-19

2. Check if the account has an expire date.
Check for the lines Password expires and Account expires to check if the account password is expired.

# chage -l username



How to set expiration date
==========================

You can set a password to expire 1/1/2021

#chage -E 2021-01-01 testuser

# chage -l testuser 
This will give you the status of the current user

# chage -W 10 testuser
The user testuser will be warned 10 days prior to his password expiring.

#chage -I 2 testuser
This example means that before user testuser’s password expires, 
his account will be inactive for 2 days before it is locked.


#chage -M 5 user1 
This will force the user to change the password in 5 days.

#chage -d 0 claude
Enabling users to change the password at their first logon
