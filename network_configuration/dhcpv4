cd /etc/dhcp
1. #yum -y install dhcp
#yum list all |grep dhcp to check services that are installed.
2.#vim /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf you dont have a sample file so we have to copy like the following:
cp /usr/share/doc/dhcp-version(4)/dhcpd.conf.sample /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf
#vim /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf
File opens:
:set number   --> go straight to line number 47

}
}
Finally restart dhcpd services 
chkconfig --list dhcpd to check at which run
level the dhcpd service is running on.
chkconfig dhcpd on
service dhcpd restart
