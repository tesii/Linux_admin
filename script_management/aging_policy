This is the script, 
I created 10 users named patty1 to patty10 alternating with the number 1 to 10
I forced the user to change password as soon as they log in
then, I set that their account will expire at the end of this year
when run this is the output
for i in `seq 1 10`
do
useradd patty$i
echo 'linux@23580' |passwd --stdin patty$i
chage -d 0 patty$i
chage -E 2023-12-31 patty$i
done
