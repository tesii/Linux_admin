Step1: Install Bind
===================
�� yum install bind* -y
N.B: if it doesn't work reboot your redhat machine
Step2: Configure the /etc/named.conf file
==========================================
First, add or edit the two values in the options field.
One is the DNS server address, and the other is the allow-query to any.
�� vim /etc/named.conf
options {

listen-on port 53 { 127.0.0.1; 192.168.0.2; }; # Master DNS Servers IP
listen-on-v6 port 53 { ::1; };
directory "/var/named";
allow-query { localhost; 192.168.0.0/24; }; # IP Range of Hosts
allow-transfer { localhost; 192.168.0.3; }; # Slave DNS Servers IP

recursion yes;
}
N.B: 192.168.0.2 ==> DNS server address
������������ The BIND package provides the named service. It reads the configuration
from the /etc/named and /etc/named.conf files.
Define the forward and reverse zones
--------------------------------------
������������ Zone is a description/definition of a domain or subdomain

Step3: Define the forward and reverse zones in the /etc/named.conf or /etc/named.rfc1912.zones
=============================================================================
(you can define zones in either of those files). In this example, I am appending zone
definition details to the /etc/named.rfc1912.zones file.
�� vim /etc/named.rfc1912.zones
zone "auca.com" IN {
type master;
file "auca.forward.zone";
allow-update { none; };
};
zone "0.168.192.in-addr.arpa" IN {
type master;
file "auca.reverse.zone";
allow-update { none; };
};
Create forward and reverse zone files
--------------------------------------
You also need to create forward and reverse zone files in the /var/named directory.
Note: By default, the named.conf file includes the /var/named directory for checking zone
files. Sample zone files named.localhost and named.loopback are created during
the installation of the BIND package.
Step4: copy sample from named.localhost and edit
�� cp /var/named/named.localhost /var/named/auca.forward.zone
�� vim /var/named/auca.forward.zone
$TTL 1D
@ IN SOA @ root.auca.com. (
202204001; serial
1D ; refresh
1H ; retry
1W ; expiry
3H) ; minimum

@ IN NS server.auca.com.
@ IN A 192.168.0.2
server IN A 192.168.0.2
client IN A 192.168.0.5
Step5: copy sample from named.localhost and edit
�� cp /var/named/named.localhost /var/named/auca.reverse.zone
�� vim /var/named/auca.reverse.zone
$TTL 1D
@ IN SOA server.auca.com root.auca.com. (
202204012; serial
1D ; refresh
1H ; retry
1W ; expiry
3H) ; minimum

@ IN NS server.auca.com.
@ IN PTR auca.com.
server IN A 192.168.0.2
client IN A 192.168.0.5
2 IN PTR server.auca.com.

5 IN PTR client.auca.com.

Step6: changing group of zone files
��cd /var/named
��chgrp named auca.forward.zone
��chgrp named auca.forward.zone
Step7: checking for configuration syntax
��named-checkconf /etc/named.conf
��named-checkzone auca.com /var/named/auca.forward.zone
��named-checkzone auca.com /var/named/auca.reverse.zone
Step8: Restoring connection now
��restorecon /etc/named.conf
Step9: Add the nameserver IP to /etc/resolv.conf
��vim /etc/resolv.conf
search auca.com
nameserver 192.168.0.2
:wq

Step10: reload (restart) NetworkManager
��service NetworkManager restart
Start/restart and enable the named service
------------------------------------------
If the named service is not running or is disabled, then start and enable it.
If it is already active (running) and you made all these configurations, you need to
restart the service to make changes.
�� service named status
�� service named start
�� service named enabled
�� service named restart
Verify the DNS name resolution
----------------------------------
You have installed the BIND package, configured named files, created lookup zones, and
restarted the service to make configurations take effect. Now use the nslookup and dig
commands to check whether DNS is working properly and verify whether you are getting the
intended results.
nslookup is a program to query internet domain name servers.
dig is a tool for interrogating DNS servers. It performs DNS lookups and displays
the answers that are returned from the nameserver.
Query with nslookup
-------------------
�� nslookup server.auca.com
Server: 127.0.0.1
Address: 127.0.0.1#53
Name: server.auca.com
Address: 192.168.0.2
�� nslookup 192.168.0.2
2.0.168.192.in-addr.arpa name = server.auca.com.
Query with dig
--------------
Here is a forward lookup, where DNS responds with 192.168.0.2 as an IP for server.auca.com:
�� dig server.auca.com
